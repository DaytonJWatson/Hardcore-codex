        - "&cHardcore Basics\n\n&7Hardcore means your world ends\non death. Log out safely, avoid\nhero jumps, and never dig down.\nCarry a shield, blocks, and a\nwater bucket. Cook extra food,\nkeep spare picks, and stash gear\ndeep underground."
        - "&cSurvival Tips\n\n&7Secure iron before exploring.\nLight caves, bridge over lava,\nand block creepers. Travel with\na bed for night-skips in groups,\nbut remember respawns do not\nundo bans. Wear gold in the\nNether, respect bastions, and\nnever fight when lagging."
        - "&cBandits & Heroes\n\n&7Unfairly killing weaker players\ngives \"unfair kills\". At &c3&7, you\nbecome a &4Bandit&7 with a red tag.\nKill &c3 bandits&7 to redeem. While\nclean, defeating &c3 bandits&7 turns\nyou into a &6Hero&7. Heroes who prey\non weak players fall back to Bandit."
